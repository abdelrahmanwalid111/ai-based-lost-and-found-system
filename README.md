# 🎓 AI-Powered Lost and Found Management System

This is my graduation project from the Faculty of Computers and Information Technology at Future University in Egypt (2021–2025). It is a full-stack, AI-driven lost and found platform that leverages **natural language processing**, **computer vision**, and **geolocation intelligence** to automate item matching and fraud detection.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Semantic Matching** using Sentence-BERT for textual item descriptions
- 🖼️ **Visual Similarity** with CLIP and ResNet for image-based item comparison
- 🚨 **Fraud Detection** using Isolation Forest
- 📱 **Mobile App** built with React Native featuring GPS and reporting features
- 🧠 **RESTful APIs** using Flask & Node.js
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, reports, analytics, and fraud alerts
- ☁️ Hosted on Google Cloud with Docker and MongoDB as the backend store
